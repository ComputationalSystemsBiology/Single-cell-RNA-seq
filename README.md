# Automatic processing of single-cell RNA seq data analysis

This repository contains tools and workflows for the analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data. Currently there are 2 workflows available:
- [SmartSeq2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2639) protocol
- [10x Genomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241818/) protocol.

These workflows are based on the workflow manager [Eoulsan](http://www.outils.genomique.biologie.ens.fr/eoulsan/index.html), which is a framework dedicated to high throughput sequencing data analysis on distributed computers. 

Here is a quick access to the main pages:
