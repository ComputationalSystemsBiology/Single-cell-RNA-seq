# Eoulsan for single-cell RNA seq data analysis

This repository contains tools and workflows for the analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data. Currently there are 2 workflows available depending on the sequencing protocol : [smart-seq2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2639) and [drop-seq](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00549-8) (such as [10x genomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241818/)).
